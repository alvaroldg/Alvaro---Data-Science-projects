Abstract
Breast cancer is positioned as the most prevalent type of malignant tumor in the female population. It is of utmost importance to recognize the relevance of early detection of this disease through the implementation of methods such as mammography and other techniques, since their application has a direct impact on the patient's prognosis. In this sense, advances in the field of artificial intelligence have demonstrated their ability to contribute to the early detection of this type of tumor, focusing particularly on invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), which is the most common form of breast cancer. This type of cancer originates in the lining of the lactiferous ducts of the breast and spreads beyond these ducts to other breast tissues. By using convolutional neural networks in IDC imaging, greater accuracy and sensitivity in identifying potential tumors is achieved. These networks are able to thoroughly analyze the details of images from scans and mammograms, highlighting suspicious regions and providing a more reliable assessment.
